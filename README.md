Below are the code projects I am currently working on: 
- **snowpoles** -- a repository for a keypoint detection model to extract snow depth from snowpoles. Paper published in Water Resources Research!
- **CV4EcologySchool/snow-Dayz** -- beta-model for a classifier to detect winter weather from camera traps using combined audio and visual information. Come check out the paper at CVPR Seattle 2024!
- **camera-traps-to-validate-satellites** -- code for the paper in Remote Sensing of Environment. This was the first ever study to use an active wildlife camera network to validate satellites for snow.
